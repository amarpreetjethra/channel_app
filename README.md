![](/public/images/app_shows_scnsht.png)

 The application helps you keep track of your favorite and must-watch TV shows, and create lists to manage and organize those shows. This is a portfolio project for the Rails section of the Flatiron School's Web Development Immersive program.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rake db:migrate
```

Then run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

To learn more about how to sign up, log in, create watchlists and add shows, [see my video walkthrough here](https://youtu.be/uua3-0aHCEM).

If you have questions about the code, please [take a look at my blog post on the process](https://alexisadorn.github.io/FavShowApp_-_a_rails_tv_show_app).
